# BankManagementSystem
The Bank Management System is a simple project demonstrating the basic workflow of a banking system using credit card authentication. It implements the widely used Luhn's Algorithm (also known as the Mod 10 algorithm) to validate credit card PINs. After successful authentication, users can access essential banking services such as:
Withdraw funds
Deposit funds
Check account balance
